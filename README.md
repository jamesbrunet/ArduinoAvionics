# ArduinoAvionics
__An arduino-powered dual deployment altimeter!__

This is an experimental system developed for Carleton University InSpace. Our goals as a development team are to:
* collect data from sensors
* rapidly write logging data to external storage
* deploy a sequence of parachutes when appropriate
* provide live telemetry to the ground

Carleton University InSpace will be competing in the Spaceport America Cup.
